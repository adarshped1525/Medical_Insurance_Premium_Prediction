Medical Insurance Premium Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting medical insurance premiums based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and more.

Project Overview

This project utilizes regression models to predict the cost of medical insurance for individuals based on demographic and health-related attributes. The dataset used includes features such as:

Age

Sex

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Number of children

Smoking status

Region

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available and consists of real-world insurance data. It has been preprocessed and cleaned before feeding it into machine learning models.

Dependencies

To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Steps Involved

Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Model Selection: Training different regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Evaluation: Comparing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-insurance-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd medical-insurance-prediction

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook "Medical insurance premium prediction.ipynb"

Results

The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics, and the results are visualized for better understanding.

Future Improvements

Experimenting with deep learning models for improved accuracy.
